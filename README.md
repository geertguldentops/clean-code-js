## What is this repository for? ##

Javascript code samples that explain the principles from the book [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) written by Robert C. Martin.

It is written in pure "vanilla" javascript (node.js) using only 2 external Javascript libraries:
 * [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started) for testing
 * [Moment](https://momentjs.com/) for working with dates in JS in a more convenient fashion.

## How do I get set up? ##

`> npm install`

### Running all the tests ###

`> npm test`
